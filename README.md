## ABOUT ME

📣 Open to opportunities from April 2024 on Paris area as React front-end developper.

🚀 I work with Javascript, Node.js, React, Redux, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Git, Tailwind, SCSS, Material UI.

😤 After 9 years of html, CSS and Wordpress (I learned alone), I wished to be able to do more things technically for users and for my former company. I was frustrated to not have much time for it.

📖 In 2022 I left my previous job and started to get educated again at CNAM and O'Clock school.

 ✒️ I would be glad to learn more about your web development needs, let's keep in touch!
