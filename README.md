## ABOUT ME

📣 React front-end developper and CSS web integrator.

🚀 I work with Javascript, Node.js, React, Redux, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sequelize, Git, twig, Tailwind, SCSS, Material UI.

😤 After 9 years of html, CSS and Wordpress, I wished to be able to do more things technically for users and for my former company. I was frustrated to not have much time for it.

📖 In 2022 I left my previous job and started to get educated again at CNAM and O'Clock school as a fullstack JS developer.

 ✒️ I would be glad to learn more about your web development/web integration needs, let's keep in touch!
